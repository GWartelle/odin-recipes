This is my first project on The Odin Project! 

This project has the goal of making me practice html basic principles, as well as git basic commands. The project is a website with several recipes. The main page links to 3 different recipes. All the recipes were taken from the website allrecipes.com.

While doing this project I learned how to properly link the different pages of my website between each other.

I also learned how to properly structure my directory, using separate folders for pages and images.

Lastly I practiced git commands, and learned how to properly upload my project on github.

I updated this project by including styles. Eventhough I mostly used only one type of selector, this was a great exercise to practice CSS.

The trickiest parts of it were keeping the ritgh margins to the right elements, while keeping the whole thing centered.
