# odin-recipes
This is my first project on The Odin Project! 

This project has the goal of making me practice html basic principles, as well as git basic commands. The project is a website with several recipes. The main page links to 3 different recipes. All the recipes were taken from the website allrecipes.com.

While doing this project I learned how to properly link the different pages of my website between each other.

I also learned how to properly structure my directory, using separate folders for pages and images.

Lastly I practiced git commands, and learned how to properly upload my project on github.
